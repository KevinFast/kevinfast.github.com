# PRIOR AFFILIATIONS

I am a former partner of the law firm of Hunton & Williams, one of the largest law firms in the world. As a seventeen year member of the firm’s “Resources, Regulatory and Environmental Law” team (seven years as an associate and more than ten years as a partner), I participated in a wide range of administrative rulemakings, judicial review proceedings, and enforcement litigation having national scope and effect. My clients have included the owners of coal-fired, steam electric generating facilities, chemical companies, and other industrial and manufacturing facilities.

I resigned my partnership with Hunton & Williams in the summer of 2005 to open my own office.

Prior to joining Hunton & Williams in the fall of 1988, I initiated my legal career as an associate with the Washington, D.C. office of Baker & Hostetler.

# EDUCATION

I am a 1986 graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law and a member of the Order of the Coif (signifying a three-year cumulative grade point average in the top ten percent of the 1986 graduating class).

I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Maryland in 1981 with a B.A. in Government and Politics and a minor in Philosophy, and was the valedictory speaker for my graduating class.
