     Welcome to the Law Office of Kevin L. Fast. As a licensed attorney with nearly forty years of experience, I am dedicated to providing <em>innovative</em> and <em>cost-effective</em> solutions to complex environmental legal problems or objectives.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary focus of my practice is implementation and enforcement of the mobile source and fuel and fuel additive provisions of the <em>U.S. Clean Air Act (Act)</em>, but I also have significant experience with the stationary source provisions of the Act.  Other federal environmental statutes with which I have experience include the storm water runoff provisions of the <em>Clean Water Act</em>, the <em>Resource Conservation and Recovery Act</em>, the <em>Superfund Act</em>, and the <em>Toxic Substances Control Act</em>. I have extensive experience with the implementation and enforcement of vehicle and fuel-related regulatory programs in other parts of the world, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, China, and South Africa.  
  </p>
  <p>
  Because of the nature of my practice, I have experience in all facets of administrative law, including the preparation of rulemaking comments, participation in rulemaking hearings, judicial challenges to regulations, preparation of rulemaking petitions under the Administrative Procedures Act, and the submission of Freedom of Information Act requests and associated information access litigation.  I also have extensive experience working closely with technical experts in the fields of human health and environmental risk assessment and vehicle emission control system design and operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    My office is conveniently located in Vienna, Virginia near Tysonâ€™s Corner in Fairfax County.  I am licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
